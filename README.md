# NodeJS GET WebServer

My take on a simple webServer that only allows GET requests. It is written in NodeJS and uses the http and fs modules.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm start` to start the server
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the server in action

## Features

- [x] Only allows GET requests
- [x] Serves static files
- [x] 404 error handling
- [x] 500 error handling
- [x] Logs requests to the console
- [x] Customizable port
